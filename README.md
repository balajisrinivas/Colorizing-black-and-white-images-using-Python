# Colorizing-black-and-white-images-using-Python
Image colorization is the process of taking an input grayscale (black and white) image and then producing an output colorized image.  The approach we are going to use here relies on deep learning. We will utilize a Convolutional Neural Network capable of colorizing black and white images with results that can even “fool” humans!
